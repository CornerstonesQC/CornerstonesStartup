# Cornerstones of Quantum Computing Pre-reading
This document contains the information needed to get you ready for attending the Cornerstones
of Quantum Computing Summer School.  The initial sections will provide references for the
concepts you’ll need to know in advance of the lectures. We'll then set up the python environment so that you can attack homework challenges


# Group guidelines
We are very happy to have the opportunity to interact with such a diverse group of students
from a variety of countries, programs, and educational backgrounds.
We are dedicated to providing a supportive learning environment for all participants. Everyone
is here to learn. As you interact during the sessions, on Slack, or anywhere else with your
fellow classmates, we ask that you adhere to the following guidelines:
   - Ask and answer questions with patience
      - No two participants will have the same background knowledge. Please ask questions when you are not sure about something, and answer the questions of others in a constructive way that helps their understanding. Everyone benefits when people feel comfortable asking questions.
   - Ensure everyone gets heard
      - Especially when working in small groups, give everyone the opportunity to share their thoughts. Please don’t interrupt when others are talking, and don’t make derogatory comments about their ideas.
   - Treat all participants with respect
      - We pledge to make these seminars a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

If you have concerns about the behaviour of another participant, please reach out to one of the organizers via Slack, or private email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and the organizers will respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. A portions of these guidelines were adapted from the Contributor Covenant: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/
